**The Power of Hope in a Negative World**

It’s pretty obvious that a positive, optimistic person will do much better on this journey of life than someone settled in the opposite camp. That isn’t to say it’s always easy to be positive or optimistic. Some days just suck, or some weeks. That’s when we need hope, a rope tossed down the well to pull us from despair.

Over the years, I have discovered something about myself that I’ve come to rely upon heavily: I always have hope. Maybe you’re the same. As a Christian woman, I know where this hope comes from. It isn’t a voice in my head, it’s more of a tugging in my soul.

I still, as a flawed human, have moments when I hope seems lost. There are times when I’m on my knees in tears, my heart aching. I struggle with occasional anxiety and melancholy as many do, but then, like a beacon in the fog, hope breaks through the darkness and wraps around me like big, strong arms around my heart.

Having hope in your soul is not to say you never struggle, it simply means there is a rope nearby to pull you from that struggle. It can quite literally save your life. As someone who struggled with post-partum depression, I’ve been in a place that scared me, a place I didn’t know how to get out of. But in time, the light of hope was able to break through. At first it was only a pin-prick, but in time, it grew.

On a lighter note, when I was about twenty-four years old, I was working in a job I had grown to despise with a passion. And transferring to a new position at the time was not happening. Impatient and hopeless, I dramatically declared I would have to quit my job and become a hooker on the streets because I would never be able to transfer from the position. I know, right?

Of course, soon after that drama, I did transfer into a new, better position. But not before I calmed down and let hope lead me forward.

Life is not easy and never will be, so if we wish to survive emotionally, mentally, and physically, we need hope. We just do.

I encourage you to find optimism in a world that screams negativity. Demand it of yourselves. Allow hope. It’s our superpower as mortals, as humans. We aren’t the only ones who benefit from our hope. It’s contagious.

I wish you all the very best in this journey called life. And when your journey is rough and rocky, may you find the light of hope that’s deep inside you and grab onto it with all of your might.

Thank you for visiting my blog and happy reading (and writing!).

_I just finished reading_ [_“The Push”_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52476830-the-push?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=i5cyunRSlz&rank=2 '"The Push"') _by Ashley Audrain. I don’t know when I last read a book written in second person, but she did it well. It added another sinister layer to the story. The ending will stick with you for while!_
