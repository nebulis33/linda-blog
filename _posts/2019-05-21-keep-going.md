[<p>I heard Savanah Gutherie\u2019s commencement speech this morning as replayed on the Today show, and it was excellent. Her words not only apply to the 2019 grads she was addressing, but they resonate with all of us. I especially feel her words in my own zig-zagged path to being a writer and getting published.</p>, <p>The goals are never-ending for me. I reach one, pause to celebrate for a minute, then push forward to the next. But in doing this, I often forget that, as Savanaha basically says, the journey is the destination.</p>, <p><img alt="Image result for picture of someone walking" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTtnOPHo0DnoZf2eGP7cCJck21A4OgY540_j_RpNTJXiIyH-YQEmQ"/></p>, <p>As a writer, I speak to fellow writers who struggle with their path for various reasons that often change day to day. This speech will inspire you to keep going. But I also share this as a person living this thing called life. We can all use these inspiring words to keep us going.</p>, <p>Here are some highlights to note from Savanah\u2019s speech:</p>, <p><em>\u201cMy path is not how anyone would tell anybody to get anywhere. It\u2019s like someone giving you directions from right here to New York City by telling you to start heading toward Miami. But what I\u2019ve realized is \u2014 no matter how many detours you take, you\u2019re going to get where you are meant to go.\u201d</em></p>, <p><em>\u201cEvery person sitting here has some kind of dream \u2014 an idea of what their lives might look like. It could be a career goal, it could be an athletic achievement, it could be the place you want to live or the family that you hope to create. Here\u2019s the thing: Whisper it to yourself if you must, but say it out loud, put it out there \u2013 don\u2019t curb your ambitions, don\u2019t tell yourself, \u2018I could never do that. I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s too much.\u2019\u201d</em></p>, <p>This is a particularly inspiring portion of the message:</p>, <p class=""><em>\u201cEvery person sitting here has some kind of dream \u2014 an idea of what their lives might look like. It could be a career goal, it could be an athletic achievement, it could be the place you want to live or the family that you hope to create. Here\u2019s the thing: Whisper it to yourself if you must, but say it out loud, put it out there \u2013 don\u2019t curb your ambitions, don\u2019t tell yourself, \u2018I could never do that. I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s too much.\u2019</em></p>, <p class=""><em><span style="color:#000000;">My advice is really simple: Think big for yourself and then, just head in that general direction. Whether you arrive at the ideal destination is not even the point. The point is to be ambitious for your life \u2026 and then just, try.</span></em></p>, <p class=""><em>Now: of course, I can\u2019t know where your fulfillment and happiness will be found. I can\u2019t tell you where your dream is. Only you know that.</em></p>, <p class=""><em>But I can tell you where it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t in your comfort zone. It isn\u2019t in your wheelhouse. It\u2019s not where you feel safe. It\u2019s not where conditions are perfect. It is not where you are usually right and rarely challenged.</em></p>, <p class=""><em>Your blossoming and your growth \u2014 which is to say, your success \u2014 is always, always, inevitably, on the other side of a risk. It\u2019s on the other side of a bold choice. It\u2019s on the edge, waiting for you, on the other side of your fear.</em></p>, <p class=""><em>This is true whether it\u2019s career, or faith, a relationship, or love \u2014 when you find it, it will only be after you\u2019ve taken that big, giant, daring leap. It will be you, standing at the tip of a ravine, or maybe it\u2019s a tall cliff rising over a deep canyon \u2026 you\u2019re looking down and looking across, your heartbeat is rising, your sweat glands are pulsing. You will be here many times. You will be called to do this again and again and again.</em></p>, <p><em>\u2026<span style="color:#000000;">And what you will find is \u2014 your obstacles, your broken places, the spots where you\u2019ve healed, the things you\u2019ve overcome \u2014 this is the source of your strength, and it also is the source of your beauty.\u201d</span></em></p>, <p><img alt="Image result for picture of someone climbing a mountain" src="https://i0.wp.com/allume.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/mountain_climbing.jpg"/></p>, <p>If you\u2019d like to see a video of her full speech or simply read the full thing, go to the Today Show page. <a href="https://www.today.com/news/read-savannah-s-guthries-full-graduation" rel="nofollow">https://www.today.com/news/read-savannah-s-guthries-full-graduation</a>. It\u2019s worth the read.</p>, <p>Mostly, I hope you walk away from this post with a bounce in your step and head out there with your purpose renewed.</p>]
