So many of us want to lose weight at some point throughout our lives. We eat healthy, exercise, and try to educate ourselves on the best ways to stay or get trim and strong.

No matter what plan of action you take, or what kind of diet you follow, the bottom line is always the same: burn those calories!

What if I told you that along with climbing stairs, hiking the mountains, walking along the beach, riding a bike, kayaking, or any number of activities, reading a book is actually among that list? It’s true! You can burn calories while reading!

Of course, you’d have to read a LOT each day to burn a substantial number of calories, but it’s nice to know that sitting in your favorite spot, curled up with a book isn’t only good for your brain, it’s good for your figure. Or at least it contributes to the daily exercise you’re already getting.

According to an article in [_Healthline _](https://www.healthline.com/health/does-thinking-burn-calories#brain-workouts "Healthline")magazine, “your brain burns more energy at rest than a human thigh while running.”

Oddly enough, you’ll burn more calories reading a book than you will while watching television, according to an article in [_The Book Buff_](https://thebookbuff.com/does-reading-burn-calories/#:\~:text=Generally%20speaking%2C%20you%20burn%20more,2%20hours%20and%2030%20minutes. "The Book Buff"). Apparently, we don’t exert as much brainpower while staring at a screen. Who knew?

When reading, we need to use our imagination and tap into our knowledge of learned tools just to read the words and sentences properly. That’s work!

“On average you’ll burn 150 calories when you read for 1 hour and 45 minutes.” You’ll need to spend about two and a half hours watching your favorite show to burn the same 150 calories, according to the same article in [_The Book Buff_](https://thebookbuff.com/does-reading-burn-calories/#:\~:text=Generally%20speaking%2C%20you%20burn%20more,2%20hours%20and%2030%20minutes. "The Book Buff").

What’s going on here? Well, according to Livestrong.com, “The [calories you burn reading](https://www.livestrong.com/article/297958-how-many-calories-does-reading-burn/ "calories you burn reading") are expended on basic metabolic and maintenance processes more than on the reading per se.”

Okay, so you won’t get svelte or cut by reading on its own (duh), but it will help add to the number of calories you burn in a day. That’s better than nothing. And as a bonus, you’ll expand your world with all the books you read!

So enjoy those books as much as you can manage. And do it guilt-free!

Thank you for visiting this blog, and happy reading!
