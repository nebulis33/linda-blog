[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;"><span style="color:#666666;">\u201cThere are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as</span><strong><span style="color:#666666;"> afternoon tea</span></strong></span><span style="font-family:Georgia;"><span style="color:#666666;">.\u201d<br/>\n</span><em><span style="color:#666666;">Henry James</span></em></span></p>, <p style="text-align:center;">\n<p style="text-align:left;">Okay, so maybe I don\u2019t dedicate a full hour of my time to taking tea in the afternoon, but the half hour I manage to carve out\xa0is very agreeable. For me, drinking tea is a calming and soothing activity while also stimulating my mind. I can take two hours to finish one cup of tea as it sits beside me on a hotplate while I type out story after story (a slight exaggeration? I think yes), sipping between bursts of brilliant ideas. Well, maybe not brilliant ideas, I\u2019d hate to take my exaggerations too far, but a flow of ideas at any rate.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">I also enjoy a nice cup of tea in the middle of the afternoon or at the end of the evening. During both of those times, the tea (the same caffeinated black tea) is consumed for comfort rather than stimulating my mind. I\u2019m a little fascinated at how the act of drinking tea can play different roles at different times, yet still be the very same tea in each instance.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">I\u2019m sure many \u201cexperts\u201d and casual tea drinkers could go on about the numerous medicinal properties of several kinds of teas, but I\u2019m not one of them. Tea is just tea to me; a simple, warm drink that is good for me as well as something that brings me comfort and at times (like when I see a Starbucks or Pete\u2019s or any tea house or caf\xe9!) joy. I also love iced tea, but I do not react to it in the same way. It\u2019s simply a cold drink I enjoy the taste of. Hmmm, it seems I might be on to something. Could it be the warmth of the drink I\u2019m being effected by rather than the content? I think maybe.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">I believe it\u2019s important, however, to find the things that comfort you. As long as those things are not harmful to\xa0ourselves or anyone else, they are necessary. So I encourage you to drink tea! Just kidding. But I do encourage you to find time in your days for activities that bring you comfort, especially in a world so full of things that do the opposite.</p>\n<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;"><span style="color:#666666;">\u201cWhile there\u2019s tea there\u2019s hope.\u201d<br/>\n</span><em><span style="color:#666666;">Sir Arthur Pinero</span></em></span></p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">\n<div class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled" id="jp-post-flair"><div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"><div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing"><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><div class="sd-content"><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" data-shared="sharing-twitter-17" href="https://lindajuliano.com/2015/01/29/all-the-ways-i-love-tea/?share=twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class="share-facebook"><a class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" data-shared="sharing-facebook-17" href="https://lindajuliano.com/2015/01/29/all-the-ways-i-love-tea/?share=facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class="share-email"><a class="share-email sd-button share-icon" data-shared="" href="https://lindajuliano.com/2015/01/29/all-the-ways-i-love-tea/?share=email" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Click to email this to a friend"><span>Email</span></a></li><li class="share-linkedin"><a class="share-linkedin sd-button share-icon" data-shared="sharing-linkedin-17" href="https://lindajuliano.com/2015/01/29/all-the-ways-i-love-tea/?share=linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Click to share on LinkedIn"><span>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li><a class="sharing-anchor sd-button share-more" href="#"><span>More</span></a></li><li class="share-end"></li></ul><div class="sharing-hidden"><div class="inner" style="display: none;width:150px;"><ul style="background-image:none;"><li class="share-pinterest"><a class="share-pinterest sd-button share-icon" data-shared="sharing-pinterest-17" href="https://lindajuliano.com/2015/01/29/all-the-ways-i-love-tea/?share=pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Pinterest"><span>Pinterest</span></a></li><li class="share-end"></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded" data-name="like-post-frame-82955015-17-5f6063648fd4b" data-src="//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20200826#blog_id=82955015&amp;post_id=17&amp;origin=lindajuliano.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=82955015-17-5f6063648fd4b&amp;domain=lindajuliano.com" id="like-post-wrapper-82955015-17-5f6063648fd4b"><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><div class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder" style="height: 55px;"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></div><span class="sd-text-color"></span><a class="sd-link-color"></a></div></div> </p></p>, <p style="text-align:left;">Okay, so maybe I don\u2019t dedicate a full hour of my time to taking tea in the afternoon, but the half hour I manage to carve out\xa0is very agreeable.
