As I was on the water this weekend, kayaking with a friend, I was reminded of the book [_The Boys in the Boat_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158542-the-boys-in-the-boat?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=qnSCGT8NOE&rank=1 "The Boys in the Boat") written by Daniel James Brown.

I read it a few years ago, but it was a wonderful book that I still feel compelled to recommend. It’s a fantastic read for anyone interested in excellent historical fiction set back in 1936 America.

Unfortunately, I did not leave a review when I read the book, and it’s been too long to properly review it from memory, so below is a blip taken off the description page from Goodreads to whet your appetite. I gave it five stars and I rarely give a book five stars, so that tells you something.

“Drawing on the boys' own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, _The Boys in the Boat_ is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times—the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant.
