[<p>Many of us are schedulers, meaning we have a daily planner and we use it. We jot down every appointment, meeting, grocery shopping trip and more. So why not schedule our writing\xa0time on the calendar or planner? I can almost hear you saying, \u201cYeah, good question. Why not?\u201d</p>, <p><img height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/cf.makinglemonadeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/free-printable-planners-daily-plan-organized.jpg" width="299"/></p>, <p><strong>Finding Time to Write </strong>is important, but <em>making</em> time to write is imperative. If you write only when you find the time, you\u2019ll likely never finish anything, or at the very least, it will take you far longer to complete that writing project than necessary. And who has time, really, for that? We are all busy, so time is important, don\u2019t let it slip away.</p>, <p>I realize I\u2019m not telling you anything you don\u2019t already know or suspect, but we all need reminders, especially if we\u2019ve gotten ourselves stuck in the \u201cI can\u2019t find the time to write\u201d mode. Shake it off and get writing! Yeah, easier said than done, right? Nope.</p>, <p>Granted, there will be times when you absolutely must stomp all over the time you carved out to write on any given day, that\u2019s true of life. But keep it to a minimum. Don\u2019t let just any activity, event, daydream, phone call, nails in need of filing, dog barking in the background or internet rabbit hole throw you off course. Schedule that stuff for another time.</p>, <p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/thedreamingwizard.com/images/site_graphics/6a00d8341ca6f253ef010535fec21b970b-800wi.jpg"/></p>, <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s hard to stay focused with so much to do,\u201d you might say. And I say, \u201cYou must if you want your writing career to get anywhere, or finish that novel or even short story.\u201d Remember, it may be short, but it takes plenty of time to\xa0mold into perfection.</p>, <p>So, how do you insure (for the most part) that you write as often as you\u2019d like, or as often as you need? It\u2019s not magic, and you don\u2019t even need to build some elaborate\xa0machine that shocks you every time you even <em>think</em> about leaving your chair. I mean you could do that, but there is an easier way: you schedule it! Like anything else that\u2019s important to you.</p>, <p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/meettheparents_lie_detector.jpg"/></p>, <p>Schedule, schedule, schedule.</p>, <p>I tell you this coming from a place of experience. I practice what I preach, and I schedule writing time on my weekly planner every week. I do. Even though the days I write are generally the same days every week, I jot down a block of time anyway. That\u2019s the only way I can be sure I\u2019ll sit down at the computer and write. I stop when I\u2019m ready to stop, but I definitely have a start time. And if something does cause me to have to interrupt my carefully planned schedule, I move my writing to another time rather than scrap it all together.</p>, <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are times when I don\u2019t write at all as planned. I am human, after all, and far from perfect. But the schedule helps minimize those occasions. You don\u2019t have to be super rigid about it, but if you have it on your calendar, chances are you\u2019ll make it work more often than not. Give it a try; it can\u2019t hurt.</p>, <p>You can take a look at this subject from a slightly different angle by visiting\xa0The Write Life<a href="https://thewritelife.com/flexibility-in-your-writing-career/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> blog </a>, an excellent resource for writers every day.
