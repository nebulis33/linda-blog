[<p>As an Indie author I\u2019m fully aware of the difficulties of getting your book noticed. I\u2019d just like to create stories and have the marketing end of things fall magically into place. Is that so much to ask? I\u2019m guessing yes. Unfortunately, to get readers to gravitate to your book, you need to be \u201cknown\u201d or have excellent marketing skills. I can assure you, I\xa0don\u2019t claim either point. But I do what I can, learning as I go, and I like to share what I know.</p>, <p>Here is a link to an article about a site where you can place your book and get more eyes on it. It\u2019s free, which is a good thing for many of us, and very simple. The site is called Bookchoice4you. Take a look. I hope it\u2019s something you find useful. I know I have. All the host asks of us (authors) is that we share information about the site with others. That\u2019s a good thing for us as well as the host of the site.</p>, <p>Here is the article (nice and short, too!):<a href="http://thestoryreadingapeblog.com/2015/05/13/30511/" rel="nofollow">http://thestoryreadingapeblog.com/2015/05/13/30511/</a></p>, <p>If you are aware of any other helpful marketing tools, please feel free to share that information here.</p>, <p>Thank you so much, and happy writing (and reading!).</p>]
