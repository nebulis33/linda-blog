So many times I hear (or read) descriptions of introverts and extroverts and how people fall into one camp or the other. It always struck me as strange that I seemed to fall somewhere in the middle of these two camps. Was I just a weirdo? Well, that may be so, but as it turns out, most people fall somewhere in the middle. So these so-called quizzes that place you in one camp or another are simply not accurate. Phew! [Here is an article/blog](http://www.fastcompany.com/3016031/leadership-now/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert-and-what-it-means-for-your-career) I found that supports this very observation.

I think most of us will find we lean towards one of those personality descriptions a bit more than the other, but we also take a few traits from the "other side". For example, I can lean towards the extrovert description in that I feel recharged in some social situations (usually with 1-3 people tops), but like introverts, I also need time alone to recharge. It depends on my particular mood at that particular time.

The extrovert side of me can also be quite outgoing (if the moon is aligned properly), but true to my introvert half, I am slow to build friendships (real friendships, not the easily acquired acquaintances).

Bottom line, none of us can be summed up quite so easily as one of only two options of personality. Each of us has a specific, unique personality that can be described in many ways on any given day.

Would you agree, or do you find yourself planted firmly in either the introvert or extrovert camp? There is no wrong answer.

Whether you land on one side or the other, or somewhere in the middle, your personality is uniquely you.

Then there is [Ambivert](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/24/both-introvert-and-extravert-ambivert_n_6177854.html). A third option that fits neatly into everything stated above.

So, try to understand who you are then embrace it ðŸ˜‰.
