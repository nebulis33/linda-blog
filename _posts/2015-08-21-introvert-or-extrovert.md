[<p>So many times I hear (or read) descriptions of introverts and extroverts and how people fall into one camp or the other. It always struck me as strange that I seemed to fall somewhere in the middle of these two camps. Was I just a weirdo? Well, that may be so, but as it turns out, most people fall somewhere in the middle. So these so-called quizzes that place you in one camp or another are simply not accurate. Phew! Here is an article/blog I found that\xa0supports this very observation.<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3016031/leadership-now/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert-and-what-it-means-for-your-career" rel="nofollow">http://www.fastcompany.com/3016031/leadership-now/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert-and-what-it-means-for-your-career</a></p>, <p>I think most of us will find we lean towards one of those personality descriptions a bit more than the other, but we also take a few traits from the \u201cother side\u201d. For example, I can\xa0lean towards the extrovert description in that I feel recharged in some social situations (usually with 1-3 people tops), but like introverts, I also need time alone to recharge. It depends on my particular mood at that particular time.</p>, <p>The extrovert side of me can also be quite outgoing (if the moon is aligned properly), but true to my introvert half, I am slow to build friendships (real friendships, not the easily acquired acquaintances).</p>, <p>Bottom line, none of us can be summed up quite so easily as one of only two options of personality. Each of us has a specific, unique personality that can be described in many ways on any given day.</p>, <p>Would you agree, or do you find yourself planted firmly in either the introvert or extrovert camp? There is no wrong answer.</p>, <p>Whether you land on one side or the other, or somewhere in the middle, your personality is uniquely you.</p>, <p><img alt="Image result for image of extrovert and introvert" class="rg_i" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSt6b2uw1ocH4qKeh_p5JseA4uvqMDuRjG6H5JFYO_fYiyNJvVY"/></p>, <p>Then there is Ambivert. A third option that fits neatly into everything stated above. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/24/both-introvert-and-extravert-ambivert_n_6177854.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/24/both-introvert-and-extravert-ambivert_n_6177854.html</a></p>, <p>So, try to understand who you are then embrace it. \U0001f609</p>]
