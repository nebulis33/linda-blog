[<p>As I stood in Pete\u2019s waiting for my tea order, I noticed how few people were there that morning. In fact, I was first (and only) in line. Then a man walked in with\xa0a baby in the stroller and ordered a drink. Moments later, the barista made eye contact with me and assured me <em>my</em> drink would be ready in just a minute.</p>, <p>So when he placed a drink cup on the pick-up counter shortly after his statement, I naturally\xa0took\xa0the cup and turned to go. I stopped, however, when I sipped the drink and was greeted by a bitter swallow of yuck. Coffee! I ordered tea!</p>, <p>That\u2019s right, I ordered tea. When I informed the barista\xa0he\u2019d made a mistake,\xa0he informed me I\xa0was drinking someone else\u2019s coffee. As the only other customer at that moment was the man with the baby, there was no doubt who the coffee belonged to. When my gaze reached his (or rather my look of horror!), he simply stared at me, looking a little dumbfounded, but not upset.</p>, <p>Embarrassed and wanting nothing more than to slink out of the establishment, I stepped to the side and waited for my order to come up so I could in fact run like hell.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, while I returned to waiting for my tea, I chose to open my mouth (mistake number one) and make nervous conversation with the other barista about my error. Never ever speak when you are nervous and feeling slightly abashed and humiliated. Trust me.</p>, <p>When I rattled on about what a dumb move I\u2019d made, she smiled and reassured me it was a common error and not a problem (in spite of Mr. Grumpy Barista\u2019s facial expression). So, to thank her for her kindness, I proceeded to insert my foot in my mouth at her expense.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m really a blonde,\u201d I said with a self-deprecating giggle, smiling innocently at the\u2026 You guessed it. The blonde barista whom I was speaking with. Mistake number two.</p>, <p>Could I curl up in a corner and pretend none of this ever happened? Or better yet, disappear?</p>, <p>Finally, after what felt like at least 30 minutes,\xa0I got my tea and walked out as fast as I could without actually running.</p>, <p>Is there a point to this story? Not really; except to caution against speaking (at all!) when you\u2019ve already cast yourself as the least-sharpest-tool in the shed once. Why go for two?</p>, <p><img alt="" class="rg_i" src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS3ZpZgXWJ60SlPLVvS-mmhjzhvMjSzLXp7Na3ZasG6aGU_3pHF"/></p>]
