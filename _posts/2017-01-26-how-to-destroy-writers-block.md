[<p>Every writer experiences\xa0those days (or weeks) when we just\xa0can\u2019t seem to write, or at least\xa0we can\u2019t seem to\xa0write anything \u201csubstantial\u201d. Technically speaking, we can always write, put words to paper. It\u2019s writing what we <em>want</em> that doesn\u2019t always come easily, or sometimes at all.</p>, <p>I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all read or been given\xa0advice from several sources on how to deal with what many call writer\u2019s block. And it\u2019s probably all good, sound advice. Or mostly. My favorite is being told to keep writing no matter what. I mean,\xa0it\u2019s excellent advice and it works\u2026most of the time. It honestly does. But sometimes I don\u2019t feel like writing anything at all. Nothing.</p>, <p><a href="http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/3/30/Write-a-Haiku-to-Someone-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid21882-728px-Write-a-Haiku-to-Someone-Step-4-Version-2.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/3/30/Write-a-Haiku-to-Someone-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid21882-728px-Write-a-Haiku-to-Someone-Step-4-Version-2.jpg" style="max-width:100%;"/></a></p>, <p>On the surface, that sounds perfectly reasonable, right? And it is, if you really <em>don\u2019t</em> want to write. What I\u2019m referring to is the complex feeling many of us writers experience\xa0of <em>wanting</em> to write while simultaneously <em>not</em> wanting to write. Get it? I\u2019m sure you do. We writers can be a nutty bunch.</p>, <p>As writers, we always want to write; we love to write, need to write. So what can we do when this frustrating state of emotions happens to us? Well, I do one of two things. I sit down and I write. Hear me out. I don\u2019t try to work on current writings, but instead I\xa0find an old story that\u2019s been sitting untouched for some time and I begin to re-write. For me, this works because I love re-writing! I love adding meat to the bones.\xa0The process stimulates my \u201cwriting muscles\u201d (that can be taken both figuratively or literally I suppose) by taking away the pressure of working on my current project while putting me back into the game. It works probably 98% of the time.</p>, <p>For the remaining 2% of the time the above tactic doesn\u2019t work (usually because I just can\u2019t muster enough of anything to even begin writing a single word), I read. I give myself permission to not write today and pick up a book and read. I\u2019ve always got one handy. For me, reading other fiction stimulates my own story-telling needs.</p>, <p><a href="https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/cover/main/desktop/2015/10/23/635812409808113570-475586934_girl%2520reading%2520pic.imgopt1000x70.jpg"><img src="https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/cover/main/desktop/2015/10/23/635812409808113570-475586934_girl%2520reading%2520pic.imgopt1000x70.jpg" style="max-width:100%;"/></a></p>, <p>Let me state the obvious. When you feel some form of writer\u2019s block, find what works for you and do it. Don\u2019t feel guilty because you aren\u2019t writing, use the time to figure out what stimulates you back into putting your words on paper (or screen). I\u2019ve learned that guilt only\xa0creates anxiety which can shut the door to creativity.</p>, <p>If you have any other suggestions or advice on the subject, please do share for every writer\u2019s benefit. If it works for you, it will most likely work for many others. So don\u2019t be shy.</p>, <p>Happy reading and writing!</p>, <p>\xa0</p>]
