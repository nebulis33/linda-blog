summary: Six authors from San Francisco and the Bay Area whose books I've read and
  enjoyed.

I have compiled a list of six authors whose books I've read and enjoyed. They are all from either San Francisco specifically (my hometown), or the Bay Area. Of course, there are so many more authors, dead and alive, famous or not, from the area, but these are the ones I know I've read and enjoyed. So far!

Here is a link to an SF Gate article that lists several more authors whose books you may wish to check out. [https://www.sfgate.com/](https://www.sfgate.com/ "https://www.sfgate.com/")

I encourage you to read at least the books I've mentioned below, but you'll find several more books from these authors that I'm sure are well worth your time. In no particular order:

1-**Alice Walker**, author of The Color Purple. (Never actually read the book, but I loved the movie!)

2-**Maya Angelou**, author of I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings and so much more. (She was once a cable car conductor in San Francisco! Who knew?)

3-**Amy Tan**, author of The Joy Luck Club (Enjoyed this book!)

4-**Isabel Allende**, author of The Japanese Lover (Great book! A multigenerational love story that stretches from 1939 during WW2 to the present. My favorite kind of story!)

5-**Ann Packer**, author of The Dive From Clausenâ€™s Pier (Excellent book! A morally complex, yet deeply satisfying novel. I read this years ago, but it still sticks with me.)

6-**Anne Lamott**, author of Blue Shoe (On my to-read list! I read a book of hers years ago, but I fail to remember which one it was. I only remember that I enjoyed it a great deal.)

Bonus, just for fun: Daniel Handler (pen name Lemony Snicket), children's author of A Series of Unfortunate Events books also lives in San Francisco. I've never read the series, but I've definitely heard about them!

While only 49 square miles (not counting Alcatraz, Treasure Island, or the Farallon Islands that are all technically San Francisco county), I've never run into these authors as far as I know. Then again, I don't exactly run in the same circles as they do.

Thanks for visiting my blog and happy reading!
