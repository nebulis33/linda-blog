[<p>I am participating in the Writing Contest: <em>You Deserve to be Inspired</em>. Hosted by <a href="http://positivewriter.com/writing-contest-you-deserve-to-be-inspired/" target="_blank">Positive Writer</a>.</p>, <p>It\u2019s been my experience that writers (or artists in general) are often cursed with heightened\xa0self-doubt. Constructive criticism, or any criticism,\xa0from the world hardly stands a chance\xa0against\xa0the ugly voice in our heads.</p>, <p>My latest bout with self-doubt had me\xa0sitting\xa0on the floor for thirty minutes, staring at the rug\xa0while\xa0contemplating quitting writing, tears pouring unchecked down my face. I couldn\u2019t see anymore why I should continue to put myself through all the torture of trying to make it in the biz. But, the thought of giving up as a writer\xa0opened a hole of despair so deep, it was frightening.</p>, <p><a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/89/21/c1/8921c12a2fed7b30c017056d4a0f7738.jpg"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/89/21/c1/8921c12a2fed7b30c017056d4a0f7738.jpg" style="max-width:100%;"/></a></p>, <p>I felt trapped. It was tortuous to continue writing, yet impossible to quit. The problem is, I love to write, to create fictional people and situations. But I also want to entertain others with that writing, give them something to enjoy, that touches their life in some way. Yes, I love to write, but I don\u2019t love to spend hours upon hours, sweating over my creations purely for my own reading entertainment.</p>, <p>A couple of weeks earlier, I\u2019d received a note from an e-zine (on-line magazine)\xa0editor about a short story I\u2019d submitted. It was a rejection letter with a piece of advice. Pure gold! It\u2019s rare to receive feedback on a submission outside of a form rejection, and I was thrilled with the opportunity to learn anything that will help me advance in my craft.</p>, <p>The note\xa0read:\xa0\u201cThis was a near miss with us.\xa0You have a great knack for detail and expressiveness, and you have a very natural style. But I was hoping for more story decisions from your main character.\u201d</p>, <p>With the proverbial lightbulb lit, I\xa0embraced the message, took the advice and got to work restructuring my piece with confidence and renewed vigor.</p>, <p><a href="http://www.meaning-and-purpose.com/Portals/0/Lightbulb%20Moment.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.meaning-and-purpose.com/Portals/0/Lightbulb%20Moment.jpg" style="max-width:100%;"/></a></p>, <p>Everything would be perfect now, right? Every piece of short fiction I sent off from now on would be flawless.</p>, <p>Wrong.</p>, <p>Knowledge is power, yes, but so is practice. I knew how to write and how to write well, but putting all the working parts into their perfect place took practice and lots of patience. I needed more practice.</p>, <p>Even with all my knowledge, I still committed what some in the writing community view as a sin. While I had explained better the \u201cwhy\u201d of it all, I\xa0had done\xa0it in such a way that I was telling rather than showing. Come on! That\u2019s writing 101. We all know about showing vs. telling. Right? So how could I have made such a rooky mistake? My reader was wrong; that had to be it.</p>, <p>So I pointed my chin northward, ignoring the gut feeling\xa0I was\xa0making the wrong decision,\xa0and\xa0sent the revised piece off, as is, to another e-zine. (Cue cringe)</p>, <p>Yep. You guessed it. It was again rejected, this time with a message that I\u2019d\xa0done too much telling, not enough showing. Duh.</p>, <p>I was devastated. Not because of the rejection specifically, but because of the\xa0self-doubt that\xa0sprouted immediately, like a weed on crack. I\xa0doubted my talent as a writer and my ability to ever find success in spite of having a completed, published novel and a growing strength in short story writing.</p>, <p><a href="http://hd-wall-papers.com/images/wallpapers/sad-pics/sad-pics-10.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/hd-wall-papers.com/images/wallpapers/sad-pics/sad-pics-10.jpg" style="max-width:100%;"/></a></p>, <p>The ugly, negative voice in my head went nuts, telling me I should quit, give up my dream, I was never going to\xa0get it right. I mean, come on, I should have known better, right? \xa0I\u2019ve been writing for a long time, studying the craft for years. I do know better! How could I have been so blind to my mistake, or even made a mistake? Mistakes are not allowed. Ever, according to the perfectionist\u2019s handbook.</p>, <p>Doubt had a stronger right hook and it was winning. I was slipping into a dark pool of despair with every passing minute, every self-pitying tear.</p>, <p>I wanted to quit so badly in that moment, but the idea of not being a writer killed me. It felt physically impossible for me to quit my craft. I mean, what else would I do? Nothing else makes me feel alive like writing, creating stories. To quit writing is\xa0tantamount, for me,\xa0to tearing off my right arm. Maybe not quite as gory, but just as painful and debilitating since I\u2019m right handed.</p>, <p>The tears had stopped, but I still felt wounded, sad. Then something strange happened. My subconscious, I realized, had already begun editing that original short story. It was moving forward, finished with all the drama while I still sat on the floor, whimpering.</p>, <p>Once again, quitting proved not to be an option for me. As frustrating as that is at times, it\u2019s also my saving grace.</p>, <p>Perseverance isn\u2019t just a word to toss around, it\u2019s an absolute necessity for anyone who is following their passion.</p>, <p><a href="http://mikespics.ca/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/2015/10/sisyphus.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/mikespics.ca/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/2015/10/sisyphus.jpg" style="max-width:100%;"/></a></p>, <p>\u201cGreat works are performed not by strength, but by perseverance.\u201d -Samuel Johnson.</p>, <p>I may always carry a certain amount of self-doubt, but that\u2019s okay, probably even healthy.\xa0The challenge is\xa0not to let it get too big.\xa0Feeling discouraged, heartbroken, frustrated and defeated,\xa0along with\xa0many more unsavory\xa0emotions,\xa0goes with the territory. To be creative is to be vulnerable, sensitive. And as painful as that can be, it\u2019s also the pressure that creates the diamond. We just can\u2019t let those feelings or insecurities\xa0shatter us.</p>, <p>Something else came out of my last session with self-doubt. I realized I was focusing far too much on reaching my end goals, or the point of so-called success,\xa0while ignoring the beauty in the journey. I love to write and I love to learn, so every minute I\u2019m doing either of those things is valuable.</p>, <p>I\u2019m consciously slowing down, savoring the\xa0process, the journey. It\u2019s not easy keeping impatience or demand for \u201cperfection\u201d\xa0in check, but it\u2019s necessary.\xa0There\u2019s a certain\xa0fulfillment only trials, time and persistence can provide.</p>, <p>I\u2019m keeping my eye out for all the success I\u2019ll encounter on my way to success.</p>]
