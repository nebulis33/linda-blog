<img src="/assets/linda.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Picture of Linda Juliano" style="float: left; margin: 3px 12px 3px 0px; border-radius: 5px;"> Linda Juliano is an author and mother who lives in San Francisco, California. She writes short stories as well as women's fiction and romantic suspense novels.

Her debut novel is "Cadence Beach", a romantic-suspense. In 2019 she won a Writer's Digest Magazine contest and was runner-up for the Booksie flash fiction summer contest. When not writing, Linda can be found walking through Golden Gate Park, hiking along the cliffs at the coastline, or haunting small-town "antique" stores (junk stores if you ask her husband) in search of vintage treasures, or losing herself in the local library.

Visit Linda's "published work" page on this website for links to her novel and published short stories.
