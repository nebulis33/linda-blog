Linda Juliano is an author of epic proportions. 
Okay, not epic, but of proportions in any case. 
Her debut novel is "Cadence Beach", a romantic-suspense. 
As she writes her second novel, a romantic women's fiction, she is simultaneously writing short stories and flash fiction 
(even shorter stories) for publication. Her first published flash fiction piece, "Over The Line", 
can be found in the October, 2017 issue of LiteraryJuice.com, an online literary magazine. 
You can also find The Blue Hat at Adelaide on-line literary magazine (March 2018) and Caged in Across The Margin e-zine 
(May 2018 issue). Stay tuned for future publications! When she isn't buried inside a book, or bent over a keyboard 
typing away furiously, she's probably watching a movie. From action films to syfy to Hallmark Christmas movies, 
she loves it all! She's also a huge fan of all things chocolate and, thank goodness, exercising. She loves the outdoors, 
but she's no stranger to the gym. Her reading choices are an eclectic mix, but at the core, she gleans the most from 
stories about human triumph after overcoming any kind of strong obstacle weather it be physical, mental or of the heart 
(WW2 stories are a favorite period). It's best if there is a happy ending, however. She's a huge fan of happy endings! 
As an author/writer, Linda's motto is to entertain the reader's mind while tugging at their heart. She hopes to accomplish 
that with every story, long or short. You can follow Linda and the trajectory of her writing career on this blog, her 
Facebook author page, LinkedIn or Goodreads. "The most fearless hearts, the audacious dreamers, have always maintained a 
sense of optimism that often flies in the face of the available evidence."-- Martin O'Malley 
"For myself, I am an optimist--it 
does not seem to be much use being anything else." --Winston Churchill
