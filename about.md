<img src="/assets/linda.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Picture of Linda Juliano" style="float: left; margin: 3px 12px 3px 0px; border-radius: 5px;"> Linda Juliano is an author and mother who lives in San Francisco, California. She writes short stories as well as women's fiction and romantic suspense novels.

As a result of having worked several years in the airline industry (and still part of an airline family thanks to her husband), Linda has traveled throughout the United States and around the world with so many more places yet to visit.

Her debut novel is "Cadence Beach", a romantic-suspense. In 2019 she won a Writer's Digest Magazine contest and was runner-up for the Booksie flash fiction summer contest.

Visit Linda's "published work" page on the website for links to her novel and published short stories.

Linda writes to entertain the reader's mind while tugging at their heart.

You can follow Linda and the trajectory of her writing career on her website, Facebook author page, LinkedIn, Twitter, or Goodreads.
