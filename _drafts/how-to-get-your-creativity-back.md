As artists of any kind, we may come to our calling naturally, but it isn’t always easy to be focused or creative. Life happens. No matter what level of talent you have, or how dedicated to your art you are, sometimes you need a break. Or you may be in need of a push to get back into the groove after that break.

**The best way to stay creative and sane?** Be mindful of when your creativity is in a slump and don’t be so hard on yourself. Give yourself permission to move in and out of your creative mode. No one can do anything all of the time except maybe breathing; and while we can’t take a break from breathing, we all need to allow ourselves creative breaks now and again.

**What to do when your creativity takes a break without permission?** You immerse yourself in that form of art. For example, if you are a painter or sculptor, visit a few museums to surround yourself with your passion. Or if you sing, watch some musicals or listen to music. And if you are a writer, read.

I’ve found that as a writer, when my creativity wanes, reading always connects me back to my creative self. The more I read in a genre that is the same as the one I write in, the better I feel. My creativity is stimulated. I find other genres are good for expanding your knowledge, or even challenging you to add another lens to your creative “eye”. But when you read in the specific genre you write, you’ll stimulate your creative juices. That’s been my experience.

Being a creative person does not mean you are creating all the time. Allow yourself time away. And when it’s time to get your creativity back or jump-start it, you know what to do.

Best of luck to you!

Thank you for visiting my blog. Until next time…
