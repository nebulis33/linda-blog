Four Phrases of affirmation to get you through your day

You’ve heard about the [power of words](https://newayscenter.com/speak-positivity-into-your-life/#:\~:text=When%20you%20speak%20Positivity%2C%20you,behavior%20with%20more%20positive%20ones. "power of words") before. Not just the written word, but the spoken word as well. I want to reaffirm that it’s true. What you speak (as well as what you think), has great power over your life and over those around you who hear your words. Whether you speak positive or negative words, both types are powerful. Let’s stick with the positive, shall we?

Every day, at least once, someone asks us how our day is going, or how we’re doing. Most of us answer with a simple “good, or “fine” and move on, even if our day has been anything but. It doesn’t matter much to the person inquiring as they’re likely operating by rote. But these responses don’t do anything to better our day or our outlook.

If you’re having a good day, say so. Answer the inquiry with a “wonderful” or “great” or anything positive that sums it up. Easy enough, right?

However, if you aren’t having a good day, it’s important that you stay true to your feelings. Say what you really feel, but add a positive spin to your reply.

For example, say something like “**I’ve had better days, but there’s still time left for this one**.” Honest with a positive spin. And more importantly, it expresses HOPE. Hope is a powerful emotion and a necessary one in bad times, or when you’re having a bad day.

When you wake up in the morning say, “**This is going to be a good (great, fantastic, lovely, wonderful) day**.” You can even take it a step further and declare **“Wonderful blessings and surprises are coming my way today”**. This will open your heart and mind to recognize the good in your day.

It isn’t magic, but words do hold power—in the form of suggestion. You’re essentially willing yourself to have a great day. And if you’re a person of faith (in God), there is more to these positive affirmations, but we won’t get into that here.

All humans experience bad days as dictated by life. There is no way around it. But there is a way through those days. One useful phrase for changing an already negative day from further impacting you is, **“This day is going to turn around. Something wonderful is coming my way”**.

Try it. It certainly can’t hurt, but there is a high probability it will help.

It's important to note that you’ll want to repeat these phrases a few times to cement them in your heart. Basically, say it until you believe it. The goal is to change your attitude from the inside out.

Another option to change your mood or day instantly: [compliment someone](https://hbr.org/2021/02/a-simple-compliment-can-make-a-big-difference#:\~:text=and%20in%20life.-,There%20is%20ample%20evidence%20that%20giving%20someone%20else%20a%20boost,benefits%20%E2%80%94%20givers%20and%20receivers%20alike. "compliment someone"). A stranger or a friend. You’ll be amazed at how good it feels to make someone else feel good.

Saying nice (and true) things to others will instantly lift your mood. Try it. I’m not exaggerating. It helps if you get a thank you or smile in return, but if not, you know you placed something lovely into their heart. Trust me, they’ll receive it at some point, even if you never see it.

You don’t need to go into a long, flowery compliment. In fact, I believe the short and sincere phrases have a stronger impact. They tend to come across better than long, rambling compliments that sound like you’re trying too hard. Keep it short and sweet.

One last tip for a positive day.

Look into the mirror and say, “**You are intelligent and kind**.” Or really, anything positive that will bolster you.

Remember, you have the power to turn a bad day into a better day. Our words are tools, we need to use them as such. And as it is with any tool, if you use it correctly, it works.
