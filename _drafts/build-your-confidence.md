**Confidence is important in so many ways**. It’s what propels us to move forward with the things we want to accomplish, big and small. Confidence is that ingredient people see that draws them to you, offering you that promotion, the new job, or even a relationship.

But for many of us, it isn’t something that comes easily. It’s something we need to build, one experience at a time, one step at a time.

How do we do that? Try this. It will raise your confidence levels every time. Honestly.

**_Try something new. Step out of your comfort zone._**

To 'try' is the keyword here. Something to get into your wheelhouse is the fact that success isn't always in the outcome; it's often in the trying alone.

We often think our confidence will be boosted if we give something new a try and discover we're a natural at that new thing. That's also why we tend NOT to try something new. We're afraid the opposite will be revealed, that we'll suck at the thing.

The truth is, confidence is gained simply by stepping out and giving something a shot.

There's something to be said for the saying '_at least I tried'_. When you tell someone you tried this or that, you'll find they're impressed before they even know the outcome. Think about it. If you tell a friend you went skydiving last week, will their initial reaction be "Oh my gosh! I can't believe you did that! Weren't you terrified?" Or will they say, "What was your form like? Did you land in the target on the ground?" Not likely the second response.

People are impressed when we try things, especially when they know those things are frightening to us. We inspire others when we try something new, even (or especially?) if we totally land flat on our face. Well, maybe not when skydiving? But you get my point.

Trying a new thing takes courage.

Sure, it feels good when we find we're good at something, or that we’re a “natural”. But honestly? That isn’t the whole key to raising your confidence levels and keeping them up there.

I’ve stepped out of my comfort zone, on purpose, many times, each time with great trepidation. But the rush I got when it was over, the thrill that I’d done it, or tried? Unbeatable.

Today, I'm a stronger and more confident person with faith in my ability to try new things. Each time I've stepped out of my comfort zone, I've gained a confidence I carry with me to the next challenge.

It takes courage every time I publish a blog post, send out a newsletter, send a short story to a magazine or literary journal, or even take a class online to further my career and knowledge of my craft. The list goes on and on. But I do those things, that's the key. That's what keeps me growing and moving forward to reach my goals.

Take inventory of what you’ve already accomplished in your life so far. You’ll be amazed at how many things you’ve done in your life that took courage. You were scared, but you gave it a shot anyway. No matter the outcome.

When I was in my early twenties, I accepted a job with the airlines. This meant I had to leave the only home I’d known in Oregon and move down to San Francisco. I packed up my little Honda CRX (the car I owned at the time) and off I went. It was terrifying! I didn’t know a soul in CA or in San Francisco, nor did I have a place to live yet. I stayed in a motel for the weekend, searching the papers for someone in need of a roommate. The stress!

Sure, the courage of youth played a part here, but taking that first step lead me to many others that followed. I met my now-husband, started a family, made wonderful new friends, and embarked on a writing career. All because I took that scary first step.

I'm a huge proponent of stepping out of your comfort zone and trying, no matter what might come of it. Just try.

Having never tried something because you let fear stand in your way is failure. But trying and not succeeding in the way you intended is pure success.

I challenge you to do two things: Redefine your idea of what success is, and step out of that oh-so-cozy comfort zone. You won't regret it.
