I once had an angel walk beside me and someone saw her!

Do you believe in ghosts? How about angels? If yes to either, do you think they ever show themselves to us?

I recently remembered an odd experience I had several years ago when I was at a doctor’s office. I’d forgotten all about it over time, but for some reason, it came back to mind.

I walked into the women’s breast health center in San Francisco to have a needle biopsy done on some suspicious lumps in one breast. I was a little nervous about what the final results would be and what challenges I might have ahead of me. When I stepped off the elevator, I turned directly into the clinic. I was completely alone, not even another patient was near me. In fact, there was only one other patient in the large waiting room, and she was at the opposite end.

When I checked in at the front desk, the receptionist asked me where my daughter was and if she was going to go back to see the doctor with me.

“I don’t have a daughter,” I told her, completely perplexed.

She looked up and frowned, scanning the entire place with her eyes. “There was a little girl who came in with you.”

“Nope. No one came in with me. I was alone.”

“That’s so strange. I saw her. She had on a pink coat…” she said, trailing off as realization dawned. She frowned then laughed nervously, promising she saw that little girl.

I believed her. A quick shiver ran down my arms. Real or not, the receptionist didn’t make it up. She actually saw someone with her own eyes, a little girl, walk into the office beside me then sit down with me in the waiting room before I checked in at the desk.

Crazy, right? In an exciting way!

I do believe in spirits and angels, and I believe they interact with us even when we are not aware of their presence.

I’ve heard several stories over the years of angels, or spirits, who show themselves for one reason or another. Not scary ghost stories, but stories about people being there one second, then gone the next. Or someone seeing a person next to someone, but that person did not see them. Like my story!

Well, whatever you want to believe or what you make of my experience, I can only say that the woman who saw the little girl, truly saw her. I have no doubt about that. I did not see her, but I felt a thrill at knowing she was there. Maybe one day when I leave this world and join my heavenly father, I’ll find out who she was, or is.

I did not have breast cancer, as it turned out. The needle biopsy took care of everything. So take what you want from that.

Thank you for visiting my blog and happy reading (and writing!).

**_Book Recommendation/suggestion:_**

I’ve just finished reading a book that I’m not entirely sure how I feel about it. I’d say I liked it, but did not love it. Although it was well written by an accomplished author, I did not enjoy the style of writing. There was way too much unimportant information throughout the story, making it slow and dull in too many places. I did a lot of skimming. But I did finish the book!

You might be asking yourself why I’m recommending this book if I didn’t care much for the style. That’s a fair question. I’m an impatient reader and I like stories that move along at a faster pace. I really do not enjoy long descriptions or unnecessary information. HOWEVER, plenty of other readers like those very things.

For example, I love the Outlander series on streaming, but I do not enjoy reading Diana Gabaldon books. I think they are too slow and slogged down with unnecessary scenes and descriptions. But you might love those pieces of the stories.

So, I suggest giving [_The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50623864-the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=G0IP9Pfz9K&rank=1 "The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue") by V.E. Schwab a try. Again, this book was well-written with an interesting plot.
